A tool that helps implement the Builder pattern in your code in more deleclarative way.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add nina

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install nina

## Usage

Let's define two builders: main and secondary

```ruby
Params = Class.new
Query = Class.new
Command = Class.new

A = Struct.new(:a)
B = Struct.new(:b)
C = Struct.new(:c)

class Flow
  include Nina

  builder :main do
    factory :params, produces: Params
    factory :query, produces: Query
    factory :command, produces: Command
  end

  builder :secondary do
    factory :params, produces: A
    factory :query, produces: B
    factory :command, produces: C
  end
end
```
Each builder has three factories: params, query, and command. Please check https://github.com/andriy-baran/toritori for related documentation.

With this setup we are able to compose objects in two different ways. Taking the definition block as an ordered list we can traverse it `top->bottom` or `bottom->top` connecting objects at each step

Wrapping
![](https://github.com/andriy-baran/nina/blob/master/assets/wrap.gif?raw=true)
Nesting
![](https://github.com/andriy-baran/nina/blob/master/assets/nest.gif?raw=true)
Lets explore what we have as a result
```ruby
# Wrapping strategy
builder = abstract_factory.main_builder
instance = builder.wrap do |build|
  # This block controlls order of building process steps
  # Allows you to provide initialization attributes
  # And specify only things you need to be added
  build.params                  # The most nested object;
  q = build.query               # query will get a reader to params
  build.command if i_need_this? # Top level object; command will get a reader to query
  build.query == q              # memoization do not allow creation of objects multiple times
  build.query(1, 2, 3)          # instead it returns first object no matter what parameters you provided later
end
instance # => #<Command>
instance.query # => #<Query>
instance.query.params # => #<Params>

# Nesting strategy
builder = abstract_factory.secondary_builder
instance = builder.nest do |build|
  build.params  # Top level object
  build.query   # query will get a reader to params
  build.command # The most nested object; query will get a reader to command
end
instance # => #<A>
instance.query # => #<B>
instance.query.command # => #<C>
```

### Delegation
We may apply delegation techique from OOD to expose methods of deeper layers
```ruby
builder = abstract_factory.secondary_builder
instance = builder.nest(delegate: true) do |build|
  build.params
  build.query
  build.command
end
instance.a # => nil
instance.b # => nil
instance.c # => nil
instance.query.c # => nil
```
If you need provide an initalization parameters for the objects
```ruby
instance = builder.wrap(delegate: true) do |b|
  # b.params(1, 2) => ArgumentError
  b.params(1)
  b.query(2)
  b.command(3)
end
instance.a # => 1
instance.b # => 2
instance.c # => 3
```

### Top level API
If you have some objects and just want to link them you can use following methods
```ruby
setup = { params: params, query: query, command: command }
Nina.link(setup, delegate: true) do |name, object| # => params.query.command
  # optionally do something
end

Nina.reverse_link(setup, delegate: false) do |name, object| # => command.query.params
  # optionally do something
end
```

### Callbacks
To do something between stages (after creation of object)
```ruby
builder_with_callbacks = builder.with_callbacks do |c|
  c.params { _1.a = 1 }
  c.params { _1.a += 3 }
  c.params { _1.a += 2 }
  c.query { _1.b = 2 }
end
instance = builder_with_callbacks.wrap
instance.query.params.a # => 6
instance.query.b # => 2
instance.c # => nil
```

We are copying callbacks from builder if had some defined
```ruby
builder_with_callbacks = builder.with_callbacks do |c|
  c.params { _1.a = 1 }
end
builder_with_callbacks_with_callbacks = builder_with_callbacks.with_callbacks do |c|
  c.params { _1.a += 1 }
end
instance = builder_with_callbacks.wrap
instance.a # => 2
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
